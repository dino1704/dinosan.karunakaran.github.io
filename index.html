<h1>My Program/Courses</h1>
<p>The program I am enrolled in is Business Technology Management.This program is about analyzing different business needs using appropriate technology based processes and learn how to communicate these effectively.</p>
<p>A course I found useful in this program was ITM200 because it was an introductory course to python which is an important coding language and a great skill to know for many business related jobs. I believe learning python is beneficial and could help appeal to companies who see that you can code in this language as well.</p>
