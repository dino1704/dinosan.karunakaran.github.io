<h1>SMO and SEO Techniques</h1>

        <!-- SEO Technique 1 -->
            <p>One great SEO technique is Keyword Research. This is where searchers can look up keywords to find what they are looking for on the website without having to scroll around or look from page to page. This is also helpful to business because they can identify what consumers are looking for by identifying what the high volume searches are and the keywords involved in the searches. Therefore business can create targeted websites with content that users would usually search up for online. Overall, keyword research provides better advantages to find out competitor's strategies, market trends and a new way to create a new approach when sellling online.  </p>
      
        <!-- SEO Technique 2 -->
            <p>Meta tags is another good SEO technique to use. Meta tags are titles and description tags that help other search engines find out about what content the page has. The information on the page helps influence the visibility and ranking of the website throughout the web. The meta title tags help attract clicks from users by having relevant keywords in them and the meta description summarizes the information presented and makes users want to visit the site by showing the websites relevance to their search history. This is also a low cost method which improves the overall visibility of websites. Some structured meta tags show how the information can be displayed in search results and shows reviews, ratings and other dates which makes the content more appealing and informative. On my website I chose to use a meta tag with a description describing 3 examples of SEO techniques that can be used and 3 examples of SMO techniques that can be used, which introduces what the topic is about on my page. </p>

        <!--SEO Technique 3 -->
            <p>Internal linking is another great SEO technique. Having these internal links are key to building a strong foundation for a website. Internal linking also helps create a clear structure for the website creating better navigation for users and users on search engines. By having related links on the page it increases visibility on the website and would want to make users stay and browse on the site rather than having one look and leaving. This also increases their time spent on the website overall and would intrigue them to come visit the website again. Links to the main content on the website can also show straightforward what the website is about and what users can do to learn more about the content presented. For example, on a personal portfolio website, having links to personal media accounts such as linkedin and instagram creates more visibility for the creator of the website and can reach more people overall. Having other links related to them such as their schools, resume and certifications can intrigue people like recruiters to see what the person is about and what they can do in a workplace. Overall internal linking is big for a website and enhances user experience and navigation.  </p>

        <!--SMO Technique 1 -->
            <p>One SMO technique I found interesting was social sharing buttons to share content to social media such as facebook, twitter or instagram. Having this on a website would allow users to instantly share the link through any type of media and increase visibility and the number of users on the website overall. Social sharing buttons are a quick way of sending such a large thing to someone on short notice and it creates engagement by reeaching a bigger audience. This way, by having their personal social media links on their website, users can click that as well and share profiles among others to see who they are looking at in terms of finding out who someone is through their LinkedIn or Instagram. Having a share button to many types of media can increase results of getting noticed by more users, for example, recruiters can share amongst one another a link for a personal portfolio and that way it is spread quickly rather than having them to copy a link and send it. This way is alot more convienent for users and a great way to share content overall.</p>

        <!--SMO Technique 2 -->
            <p> Another good SMO technique is profile optimization. This is where having a type of profile on the website appeals to users to show them who you are. Having a picture that stands out and looks professional shows that business and other users can take you seriously. Using a bio or about the company description is also important and is included in profile optimization because this can tell users what the company is about or for example, for a personal portfolio website what the person is about and who they are and learning about some information about them. This engages users to find out about who the person or company is about and gain more insight about what the website is about and represents. Including social media profiles is important in this, for example adding a company facebook or instagram where users can look up and find out more information about the company. Overall having a profile shows users who you are and can create an instant connection between the user and the website.  </p>

        <!--SMO Technique 3 -->
            <p>Test headlines is another SMO technique I found interesting because when posts are made on social medias such as instagram or linkedin having a strong headline for the post depends on if the users would be engaged to look at the post or not. Having some posts on the website is useful to have so the user can see examples of what the company is like or in a personal portfolio case, what the person is like in their lives. A post with a catchy headline can easily go viral depending on what it is and having a strong caption also would attract many users to see what the post is about and can increase likes and views to the post. Using different headlines and captions for different social medias is also important so posts are not boring or repetitive if users follow the account on multiple social medias. This creates more diversity and overall represents a better look on the website. This technique also increases engagement from users as they can comment on the post about their posts or contact with feedback from the website. </p>
